		<h2 class="lead">
			The SPFL Playoffs are actually 2 different championship tournaments at the same time.  The first of which is what you would expect, the top teams competing for the winning spot in the league, The Thunderbird Bowl.  The second championship is hardly glamorous at all, and is actually a fight to save yourself from being called the worst team in the league, The Sonny Bono Bowl.

		<h2 class="lead"><strong>Thunderbird Bowl</strong></h2>
		<p>
			The T-Bird Bowl is a battle of the top 8 teams in the league for all of the glory.  The playoff tournament is seeded with the top teams from each division, and then seeded based on league standings. Seeding ties are broken first by inter-divisional record, and second by total points scored during the regular season.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are in the T-Bird, your season continues on for the next 3 weeks.  You will continue to use the ESPN Fantasy app just as you have all season, setting your lineups, making roster changes, etc.  Your matchups in the application will either lead you to the championship matchup of the Thunderbird Bowl, or you will be washed out in weeks 1 or 2.
		</p>
		<p>This year's Thunderbird Bowl Teams are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Not Racist Redskins (1)</li>
				<li>Cinn Top Chad Bottom (2)</li>
				<li>Where's Tom Carpenter (3)</li>
				<li>Swoopes There It Is (4) </li>
				<li>Armchair Peak Quarter Pipers (5)</li>
				<li>Haushka Like Me Now (6)</li>
				<li>Half Nelson Full Bennett (7)</li>
				<li>Yukon Cornelius Mustache Ride (8)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Congradulations for making the playoffs if you are one of these teams, and good luck in the weeks to come. 
			</p>

	   	<h2 class="lead"><strong>Sonny Bono Bowl</strong></h2>
  		<p>
  			The Sonny Bono Bowl is exactly what you don't want.  This is the losing trophy, and establishes who is just fucking terrible at fantasy this year.  The Sony Bono Bowl is similar to the Thunderbird Bowl, except it's the opposite.  It's essentially a tournament of the bottom 8 teams in the league, but inverted, so the team that advances each round is the losing team rather than the winning team.  The winner of the Sonny Bono Bowl will establish how hard they suck by losing 3 games in a row during the tournament.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			The Sonny Bono Bowl works a little differently than the playoffs.  If you are playing in the Sonny Bono Bowl, you'll continue to use the ESPN Fantasy app to set your lineups, make roster changes, etc.  The difference is that the matchup you see in the app is not your actual matchup after week 1.  You will need to use this website to check who your opposing team is, and what the outcome of that matchup is.  Whoever wins or loses in the app does not matter, but the performance of your team in the app does.  The website will be updated with lineup changes 4 times, once on Thursday before the first game of the week, the second on Sunday Morning before kickoff of the Sunday games, the third prior to the Monday Night Football game, and fourth after the end of the week with final scores for the matchup.
  		</p>
  		<p>This year's Sonny Bono Bowl contenders are:</p>
		  	<ul>
				<li>Flacco Seagulls (9)</li>
				<li>Here So I Don't Get Fined (10)</li>
				<li>Welsh Sheep Shaggers (11)</li>
				<li>Team Pleather Mamas (12)</li>
				<li>Here For The Beer (13)</li>
				<li>La Casa de Kickin' Wing (14)</li>
				<li>Alpental Angry Pikas (15)</li>
				<li>Wildside South Stewards (16)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			You should all be ashamed of your performance this season if you are one of these teams.  Pray that you do not become the new Sonny Bonno Bowl Oner.  Good luck in the weeks to come, don't fuck it up.

		<h1 class="display-4"><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
		<div>
			<h2 class="lead"><strong>I'm in the playoffs, what now?</strong></h2>
			<p>
				Just play like you normally would.  Try your darndest to win.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 class="lead">
				<strong>What happens when I'm knocked out of either of the tournaments?</strong>
			</h2>
			<p>
				ESPN will continue to give you matchups, these are just for fun and don't affect your league standings.  You can also continue to make roster changes and trades.  Keep in mind that the players continuing on might sweeten any trade deal significantly in order to secure players during weeks 16 and 17.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 class="lead">
				<strong>Why aren't my Sonny Bono Bowl matchups the same as my matchup in ESPN?</strong>
			</h2>
			<p>
				ESPN Fantasy doesn't allow you to do this style of inverted tournament, so the league commissioner stayed up late one night and built a website to make it work.  Shut up and like it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 class="lead">
				<strong>Why should I bother to play now that I'm in the Sonny Bono Bowl?</strong>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Because you don't want the Sonny Bono Bowl.  If you remember from the beginning of the season, the winner of the Thunderbird is allowed to make a punishment for the "winner" of the Sonny Bono Bowl.

				<strong>I made a change in ESPN Fantasy App, but it's not showing on the Sonny Bono site, what gives?</strong>
